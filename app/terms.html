				<li class="mb-8">The following terms of this section entitled "Dispute Resolution for Users in the
					United
					States" apply if you reside in the United States:
				</li>
				<li class="mb-8">(i).&emsp;Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes. We each agree that any dispute, claim or
					controversy arising out
					of or relating to this EULA or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity
					thereof
					or the use of the Services or Content (collectively, <span class="font-bold">“Disputes”</span>) will
					be resolved
					<span class="font-bold">solely by binding, individual arbitration and not in a class, representative or consolidated
            action or proceeding</span>. You and KAMORA agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs
					the interpretation and enforcement of this EULA, and that you and KAMORA are each waiving the right
					to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall survive
					termination of this EULA.
				</li>
				<li class="mb-8">(ii).&emsp;Exceptions and Opt-out. As limited exceptions to subsection (a) above: (i)
					you may seek to resolve
					a Dispute in small claims court If it qualifies; and (ii) we each retain the right to seek
					injunctive or
					other equitable relief from a court to prevent (or enjoin) the infringement or misappropriation of
					our
					intellectual property rights. In addition, <span class="font-bold">you will retain the right to opt out of arbitration
            entirely and litigate any Dispute</span> if you provide us with written notice of your desire to
					do so by email at <a href="mailto:contact@kamora.vn">contact@kamora.vn</a> within thirty (30)
					days following the date you first agree to this EULA.
				</li>
				<li class="mb-8">(iii).&emsp;Conducting Arbitration and Arbitration Rules. The arbitration will be
					conducted by the American
					Arbitration Association (“<span class="font-bold">AAA</span>”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules
					(the “<span class="font-bold">AAA
            Rules</span>”) then in effect, except as modified by this EULA. The AAA Rules are available at
					www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. A party who wishes to start arbitration must submit a
					written
					Demand for Arbitration to AAA and give notice to the other party as specified in the AAA Rules. The
					AAA
					provides a form Demand for Arbitration at www.adr.org. If your claim is for U.S. $10,000 or less,
					you
					may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to
					the
					arbitrator, through a telephonic or video-conference hearing, or by an in-person hearing as
					established
					by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds U.S. $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by
					the
					AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) where you live, unless
					we
					both agree to a different location. The parties agree that the arbitrator shall have exclusive
					authority
					to decide all issues relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability and scope of this
					arbitration agreement.
				</li>
				<li class="mb-8">(iv).&emsp;Arbitration Costs. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees
					will be governed by
					the AAA Rules. If we prevail in arbitration we’ll pay all of our attorneys’ fees and costs and won’t
					seek to recover them from you. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of
					attorneys’ fees and expenses to the extent provided under applicable law.
				</li>
				<li class="mb-8">(v).&emsp;Class Action Waiver. YOU AND KAMORA AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST
					THE OTHER ONLY IN
					YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR
					REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, if the parties’ dispute is resolved through arbitration, the
					arbitrator may not consolidate another person's claims with your claims, and may not otherwise
					preside
					over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be
					unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution section shall be null and void.
				</li>
				<li class="mb-8">(vi).&emsp;Severability. With the exception of any of the provisions in the Class
					Action Waiver described in
					subsection (e) of EULA, if an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction decides that any part of
					this EULA is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this EULA will still apply.
